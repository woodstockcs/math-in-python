# Lesson: Math in Python

### Part 1: Instruction
Watch the following videos to help you get started on this lesson. Take notes on your copy of the slides so you can refer back to the information later.

### Part 2: Exploration
1. If you're not already in your `unit_5` directory, `cd` into it.
1. Make a new file called `mathiness.py`.
1. Open that file.
1. Find the packet called "Packet: Math in Python" (paper copy in the classroom, digital copy [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6wBwD0pwox6T1l6MUM5Z25TNmUzOFhsQkxqT0FNZEoxR1lF/view))
1. Work on that packet, writing code in your `mathiness.py` file, and running the file when you need to. Comment out code that you don't need anymore. (don't delete it!)
1. When the packet tells you to write code in "the interpreter", go to the command line and just type `python`. This will give you a `>>>` prompt, using `exit()` to get out the python interpreter and back to the regular command prompt.
1. When you're done with the packet, compare your answers to the sample solutions (on paper in the classroom). Update your paper (don't erase) with new things you learn from this comparison.
1. Put the finished packet in your folder in the classroom.

### Part 3: Mastery Check
1. Then go back to google classroom, open up the assignment questions, and copy/paste a screenshot of the code you wrote for the *lunch order* program you wrote at the end of the packet.
1. Then answer the rest of the assignment questions and press 'Turn in'.
