# Math in Python

1. If you're not already in your `unit_5` directory, `cd` into it.
1. Make a new file called `mathiness.py`.
1. Open that file.
1. Grab one of the packets called "Packet: Math in Python" (digital version in the google classroom, paper version in the IRL classroom).
1. Work on that packet, writing code in your `mathiness.py` file, and running the file when you need to. Comment out code that you don't need anymore. (don't delete it!)
1. When the packet tells you to write code in "the interpreter", go to the command line and just type `python`. This will give you a `>>>` prompt, using `exit()` to get out the python interpreter and back to the regular command prompt.
1. When you're done with the packet, check your answers against the provided solutions.
1. Then go back to google classroom, open up the assignment questions, and copy/paste a screenshot of the code you wrote for the *lunch order* program you wrote at the end of the assignment.
1. Then answer the rest of the assignment questions and press 'Turn in'.
